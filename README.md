# Genealogy Explorer
A way to explore a database with genealogical events such as Marriages, Births, and Deaths. The goal of this project is to take data obtained from newspapers and churches and link the data programmatically.

I will most likely not be putting much more work into this project, but I will still be using it as I am using it to enter data into my genealogy database.
